    """Top-level wrapper for FPGA control and readout. 

    The core routines to access the FPGA are in c/fpga.[ch]. We access
    parts of that through the Cython pyFPGA.pyx, which we subclass
    here to add python routines. Basically, we want to push all C
    access into fpga.c and pyFPGA.pyx. In practice, all that we
    encapsulate are the routines which need direct mmap access, and
    one single readLine() routine. pyFPGA.FPGA wraps that C readLine()
    with one (moderately complex) readImage() method.
